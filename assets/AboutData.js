        the Federal Government had, in 2010, approved the establishment

        education for the teeming Nigerian youths. As part of the 
        effective planning, the Federal Government set up an 
        Implementation Committee comprising of the National Universities 
        Commission (NUC), the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND) 
        and other relevant stakeholders. The Committee consulted widely 
        with the respective State Governors and paid inspection visits 
        to the proposed sites for the Universities before submitting its 
        report on 15th November, 2010.

        in February, 2011, with the establishment of nine Universities,
